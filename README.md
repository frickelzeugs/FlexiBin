# FlexiBin

## What is FlexiBin?
A smart garbage bin enclosure based on a height-adjustable desk. Controlled locally via push-button or via MQTT with an ESP32.

## Why?
Because the 3 garbage cans in our front garden had been an eyesore for many years and we now wanted a nice enclosure/covering for them. Last year the time had finally come.
Of course, there are already countless off-the-shelf solutions available for this problem, but none of them are smart. So I thought: "Hey, why not completely over engineer a new solution for that problem?" :wink:
